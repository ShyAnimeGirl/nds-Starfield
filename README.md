# nds-Starfield
I wrote this in early 2014 on my CR48 running an extrenmly riced out crunchbang install. I strung it together by reading through the example projects provided with devkitpro at the time.
I had thought the source code was lost to time but I recently found it was hiding inside of that example projects directory!
It is a recreation of the classic [STARFIELD](http://swfchan.com/1/532/?starfield.swf) flash loop. The song is [Tekilla Groove by Zalza](https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=66518).
To build simply install [devkitpro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)'s nds-dev package and the standard c++ build tools, then run make and it should just werk! Alternatively the NDS rom is provided.
